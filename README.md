Ansible Role - CHANGEME
==========================
This repo contains a template for an Ansible role. Be sure to adjust the contents of the following files and then write your tests and role code:

1. [This file!](README.md)
2. [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
3. [TESTING](TESTING.md)
4. [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)
5. [Kitchen Test](.kitchen.yml)
6. [Galaxy metadata](meta/main.yml)

Doing a `grep -rl CHANGEME .` is a good idea ;)
